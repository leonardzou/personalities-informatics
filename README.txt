How to use:
        As long as all files are kept where they are, serving index.html in IVLE will bring
        you to the home page. From there, things should be pretty self explanatory.
        
        The menu in the top right corner will allow you to navigate to our hypotheses
        and pivot table.
        
        The pivot table allows you to choose a row and a column category to view against a score of your choosing
        The filter function allows you to limit the results to things that fit the chosen criteria.
            For Example, if you wanted to see how age and race affect openness among Australians,
                         you would choose "Age" and "Race" as your row and column category,
                         "Openness" as the aggregation and you would filter by ISO, Australia
        
        Enjoy :)
