                <p>Agreeableness is an indication of how much you try to please others, as well as how much you like other people in general.<br><br>
People with higher scores in agreeableness are more likely to view others as honest and trustworthy.
Conversely, people who score low on agreeableness are usually less concerned about the affairs of others.
As a result, people with low agreeableness scores are often more skeptical or suspicious of other people than most.
<br><br>
We hypothesised that as people get older, they become more likely to have higher agreeableness scores.
Our rationale is that older people have a larger view of the world than those younger than them.
People of school age are often only exposed to people within their school in their daily lives, and as a result have a narrower view of the world than someone who is in the workforce and interacts with many different kinds of people.
Within these narrower views of the world, younger people are more likely to believe generalisations that are made and have less consideration of nuances that may arise in different situations.
It is also often the case that those in their teenage years are far more cynical and likely to hold the belief that they know everything (much to the dismay of parents).<br><br>

                    Our graph shows a positive correllation between age and agreeableness score, with a <b><u>Kendall Tau Rank Coefficient of 0.55</u></b>, supporting our hypothesis that older people have higher agreeableness scores.<br></p>
                
                <div class="inner" id="chart2" style="width:100%; height:500px;"></div>
                <div class="inner" style="height:40px;"></div>
                
                <p>Neuroticism refers to one's tendency to experience negative emotions such as anxiety and depression.<br><br>
Those who score highly on neuroticism are more like to be stressed or feel threatened in ordinary situations.
As a result, these people are usually self-conscious and shy.
<br><br>
Our hypothesis was that Non-native English speakers in the USA would have higher neuroticism scores than native English speakers.
This is due to the belief that people who do not speak or are less proficient the primary language of a community may feel alienated or isolated from the rest of the community.
This feeling of isolation is likely to make one experience emotions associated with neuroticism as listed above.
<br><br>
                    Our graph shows that it is indeed the case that non-native English speakers in the USA do have higher neuroticism scores, again supporting our hypothesis.<br></p>

                <p>Conscientiousness is a reflection of how careful and orderly someone is.<br><br>
Conscientious people are generally those that are considered to be hardworking and reliable.
However, at the extreme, they can also be viewed as people who are perfectionists or compulsive in their behavior.
On the opposite side of the spectrum, people who have lower scores for conscientiousness are considered to be more laid back and relaxed.
Very low scores for conscientiousness may also be indicators of laziness and lack of ambition.
<br><br>
Our hypothesis was that left-handed people would have higher conscientiousness scores.
This is due to the fact that left-handedness occurs far less frequently amoung people than right-handedness.
Since the majority of tools are created for the use of right-handed people, left handed people would seem to require more attention when performing tasks using such tools.
Such care to avoid misuse or injury would likely become engrained within a left-handed person's thoughts.
For example, for a task such as writing (left to right), a left-handed person would need to be more aware of the movement of their hand as not to interfere with what has just been written.
It would seem that from this, left-handed people would develop habits that make them more careful in their actions.
<br><br>
Our graph shows that among left-handed, right-handed and ambidextrous people, left-handed people are the least conscientious.
This goes against our hypothesis that predicted that left-handed people would be the most conscientious.
The graph shows that the differences between left and right-handed people is quite small but ambidextrous people are much more conscientious than the others.
This may be because when performing a task, an ambidextrous person takes into consideration which hand is more suited to performing a task, and are hence more analytical in their approach.
It may also be the case that those who are ambidextrous became so through their conscientious nature.
                    By training themselves in the proficient use of both hands, it may be the case that it is conscientiousness that breed ambidexterity.<br></p>

                                <p>Extraversion is an indicator of how much you gain satisfaction from interacting with others.<br><br>
A high extraversion score suggests that one may be an extrovert.
On the opposite side of the sprectrum, one with a low extraversion score is much more likely to be an introvert.
Where extroverts enjoy socialisation and often actively seek it, introverts find social situations tiring and have the tendency to dislike or avoid interactions with others.
It is often the case that introverts place a greater value on rest, while extroverts are more likely to seek stimulation.
Due to these dispositions, extroverts generally perform well in social interactions due to their more sizable experience while introverts are more often socially awkward.
<br><br>
We hypothesised that of the countries represented in the survey, Australians would have noticably higher extraversion scores than most other countries.
Given the friendly and outgoing attitudes of the majority of the Australian population, it would not be surprising to find that Australians are more extraverted than most.
Australians also have a more welcoming and friendly culture relative to most of the world, which should also be reflected by high extraversion scores.
<br><br>
Our graph presents Australians as having average extraversion among the nations of the world.
This is a very surprising discovery based on how great Australians are.
One possible reason for this low result is that Australians are incredibly modest compared to their international counterparts, skewing the scores lower than expected.
Another potential reason is that Australians see high levels of extraversion as normal, and hence their internal scale for judging extroverted activity is different.
                    Yet another possible explanations is that the average extroverted Australian is out in the world being sociable while those that remain at home doing psychology tests lean towards being more introverted. <br><br>

                    <p> Openness reflected how much one seeks out new experiences. <br><br>
A person who scores high for the openness trait is more likely to try things they have never tried before, as well as being more likely to accept new ideas.
Conversely, open who have lower openness score are more questioning of things outside what they know.
These people are more likely to be perceived as stubborn and less likely to change their minds when subjected to a view differing from their own.
<br><br>
Our hypothesis was that people of mixed race would have higher openness scores.
People of mixed race are often subjected to more different cultures from a young age.
Since these people have seen differing ways of life that can coexist, mixed race individuals could be more accepting of differing ways of life, instead of viewing them as intinsically wrong.
<br><br>
                        Our graph shows that with the exception of those of an Arctic or European Caucasian background, mixed race scores were among the highest openness scores.<br></p>
